Write a 3-email cold outreach sequence for prospects like these:
{prospect_summary}

Requirements:
- Email 1: Personalized cold observation + one question. Under 75 words. No pitch.
- Email 2: Follow-up 3 days later. Different angle, one concrete proof point. Under 75 words.
- Email 3: Break-up email 4 days after that. Under 40 words. Gracious, not guilt-tripping.
- Use {{{{first_name}}}}, {{{{company}}}}, {{{{title}}}} as merge variables — every email
  must use at least one, and email 1 must reference something specific to
  these prospects' industry or role (use the notes above).
- Never be pushy or salesy. Be consultative and value-driven.
- Subject lines: lowercase, 2-5 words.
- Follow every rule in the STRICT EMAIL RULES above. No exceptions.

Return ONLY a JSON array (no markdown fences, no commentary):

  {{"step": 2, "subject": "...", "body": "...", "delay_days": 3}},
